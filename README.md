Clone the file and the program can be executed from the terminal, no editor is required
Navigate(cd into) to the js file in the command-line interface run with node 
$ node <file name> ( In this case: $ node working.js )

Try user inputs:
1 through 6
"Q" or "q" to quit 
"R" or "r" to restock
anything else is invalid

Can easily add as many as drinks to the source code for more user inputs!
